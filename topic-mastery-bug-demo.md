# Critical Bug Fix: Topic Mastery Update Logic

## üö® The Bug

**Location**: `src/app/api/practice-sessions/[sessionId]/submit/route.ts`

**Problem**: When a user answers multiple questions from the same topic in a single session, only the first question's result was used for topic mastery calculation.

### Before (Buggy Code)
```typescript
// BUG: Only uses find() - gets first match only!
const topicMasteryUpdates = Array.from(topicIdsWithNewAttempts).map(topicId => {
  const attemptResult = results.find(r => {
    const questionData = questionDataMap.get(r.question_id.toString());
    return questionData?.topic_id === topicId;
  });
  return {
    topicId,
    isCorrect: attemptResult?.is_correct || false  // ‚ùå Only first question!
  };
});
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```typescript
// FIXED: Pass ALL individual question results
const topicMasteryUpdates: Array<{ topicId: number, isCorrect: boolean }> = [];

for (const result of results) {
  const questionData = questionDataMap.get(result.question_id.toString());
  if (questionData?.topic_id) {
    topicMasteryUpdates.push({
      topicId: questionData.topic_id,
      isCorrect: result.is_correct  // ‚úÖ All questions included!
    });
  }
}
```

## üìä Impact Example

**Scenario**: User answers 3 questions from "Photosynthesis" topic
- Question 1: ‚ùå Incorrect 
- Question 2: ‚úÖ Correct
- Question 3: ‚úÖ Correct

### Before Fix (Buggy Behavior)
```
Topic Mastery Update: { topicId: 5, isCorrect: false }
Result: Only 1 question counted, marked as incorrect
Accuracy: 0% (completely wrong!)
```

### After Fix (Correct Behavior)
```
Topic Mastery Updates: [
  { topicId: 5, isCorrect: false },  // Question 1
  { topicId: 5, isCorrect: true },   // Question 2  
  { topicId: 5, isCorrect: true }    // Question 3
]
Result: 3 questions counted, 2 correct
Accuracy: 66.7% (correct!)
```

## üéØ Technical Details

**Root Cause**: `Array.prototype.find()` returns only the first matching element, ignoring subsequent matches.

**Solution**: Changed from aggregating per topic to passing individual question results to the existing `updateTopicMasteryBatch` function, which correctly handles multiple results per topic.

**Backward Compatibility**: ‚úÖ No breaking changes - the fix works with the existing `updateTopicMasteryBatch` function interface.

## üîç How the Bug Manifested

1. **Inaccurate Topic Mastery**: Topics would show incorrect progress
2. **Unfair Recommendations**: AI recommendations based on wrong mastery data
3. **Poor User Experience**: Users would see incorrect topic difficulty assessments
4. **Data Integrity Issues**: Historical mastery data would be permanently incorrect

## ‚úÖ Verification

The fix ensures that:
- ‚úÖ All questions from the same topic are counted
- ‚úÖ Mastery calculations are accurate
- ‚úÖ Existing function interfaces remain unchanged
- ‚úÖ Performance is maintained (O(N) complexity)
- ‚úÖ No additional database queries required

This was a **critical data integrity bug** that could significantly impact user experience and learning analytics.
