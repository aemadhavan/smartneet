### Key Concepts

#### 1. Growth: The Irreversible Increase

Growth is defined as an **irreversible, permanent increase in the size** of an organ, its parts, or an individual cell, typically accompanied by an increase in dry weight. It is a metabolic process that consumes energy.

*   **Indeterminate Growth:** Plants exhibit a unique ability for unlimited growth throughout their life. This is due to the presence of **meristems**, which are localized regions of actively dividing cells. This is called an **open form of growth**.
*   **Phases of Growth:** Growth occurs in three distinct phases:
    1.  **Meristematic Phase:** Characterized by rapid cell division in the root and shoot apices. Cells are rich in protoplasm with large nuclei.
    2.  **Elongation Phase:** Cells proximal to the meristematic zone undergo enlargement, vacuolation, and new cell wall deposition. This phase accounts for the primary increase in length/size.
    3.  **Maturation Phase:** Cells attain their final form and function. This phase involves major structural changes in the protoplasm and cell walls.

*   **Growth Rates:** The rate of growth can be expressed mathematically.
    1.  **Arithmetic Growth:** The rate of growth is constant. Following mitosis, one daughter cell continues to divide while the other differentiates. It results in a **linear growth curve**. Example: A root elongating at a constant rate.
    2.  **Geometric Growth:** The initial growth is slow (lag phase), followed by a rapid exponential increase (log phase), and finally slows down to a stationary phase due to limited resources. This produces a characteristic **Sigmoid (S-shaped) growth curve**. It is typical for an organism or its parts growing in a natural environment.

*Figure: The two primary growth curves. (a) Arithmetic growth showing a linear increase. (b) Geometric growth showing a characteristic Sigmoid (S-shaped) curve with lag, log, and stationary phases.*

#### 2. Differentiation, Dedifferentiation, and Redifferentiation

These three processes describe the changes in a cell's structure and function throughout a plant's life.

*   **Differentiation:** The process by which cells derived from meristems mature to perform specific functions. This involves significant structural changes. For example, to form a tracheary element, a cell loses its protoplasm and develops a strong, lignocellulosic secondary wall.
*   **Dedifferentiation:** The phenomenon where differentiated, living cells that have lost the capacity to divide regain it under certain conditions. Example: The formation of **interfascicular cambium** and **cork cambium** from fully differentiated parenchyma cells.
*   **Redifferentiation:** The process where dedifferentiated cells divide and produce new cells that once again lose the capacity to divide and mature to perform specific functions. Example: The secondary xylem, secondary phloem, and cork cells formed by the cambium are redifferentiated tissues.

#### 3. Development and Plasticity

**Development** is the sum of all changes that an organism undergoes during its life cycle, from seed germination to senescence. It is the product of **Growth + Differentiation**.

*   **Plasticity:** Plants follow different developmental pathways in response to environmental cues or phases of life, leading to the formation of different kinds of structures.
    *   **Heterophylly** is a prime example of plasticity. It refers to the occurrence of different leaf forms on the same plant.
        *   **Developmental Heterophylly:** Leaves on a juvenile plant are different from those on a mature plant (e.g., in cotton, coriander, larkspur).
        *   **Environmental Heterophylly:** The shape of leaves depends on the environment. In buttercup (*Ranunculus*), leaves produced in water are finely dissected, while those produced in air are broad and lobed.

*Figure: Heterophylly in (a) larkspur, showing different leaf shapes in juvenile vs. adult plants, and (b) buttercup, showing different leaf shapes in terrestrial vs. aquatic habitats.*

#### 4. Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs)

PGRs (or phytohormones) are small, simple molecules that act as chemical messengers to regulate plant growth and development.

*   **Groups of PGRs:**
    1.  **Growth Promoters:** Involved in cell division, enlargement, flowering, etc. (Auxins, Gibberellins, Cytokinins).
    2.  **Growth Inhibitors:** Involved in responses to stress, dormancy, and abscission (Abscisic Acid, Ethylene). *Ethylene can be both a promoter and an inhibitor but is largely considered an inhibitor.*

##### Auxins: The Master Growth Hormone

*   **Discovery:** Charles and Francis Darwin observed that the coleoptile of canary grass bent towards a unilateral light source. F.W. Went later isolated **Auxin** from the tips of oat coleoptiles.
*   **Types:** Natural (IAA, IBA) and Synthetic (NAA, 2,4-D).
*   **Key Functions:**
    1.  **Apical Dominance:** The apical bud inhibits the growth of lateral (axillary) buds. Decapitation (removal of the shoot tip) promotes lateral branching.
    2.  **Root Initiation:** Promotes rooting in stem cuttings for plant propagation.
    3.  **Flowering:** Promotes flowering in plants like pineapples.
    4.  **Prevents Abscission:** Prevents the early drop of fruits and leaves but promotes the abscission of older, mature ones.
    5.  **Parthenocarpy:** Induces fruit development without fertilization (e.g., in tomatoes).
    6.  **Herbicide:** 2,4-D is a selective herbicide used to kill broad-leaved (dicot) weeds in monocot fields.

##### Gibberellins: The Bolting & Elongation Hormones

*   **Discovery:** E. Kurosawa identified it from the fungus *Gibberella fujikuroi*, which caused the "bakanae" (foolish seedling) disease in rice.
*   **Key Functions:**
    1.  **Stem Elongation:** Increases the length of the axis, famously used to increase the length of grape stalks and the yield of sugarcane (by up to 20 tonnes per acre).
    2.  **Bolting:** Induces internode elongation (bolting) just before flowering in rosette plants like cabbage and beet.
    3.  **Breaks Dormancy:** Overcomes seed and bud dormancy.
    4.  **Malting Process:** GA₃ is used to speed up the malting process in the brewing industry.
    5.  **Delays Senescence:** Delays aging, allowing fruits like apples to be left on the tree longer to extend the market period.

##### Cytokinins: The Cell Dividers

*   **Discovery:** F. Skoog and his co-workers discovered **kinetin** (a modified adenine) from autoclaved herring sperm DNA. The first natural cytokinin, **zeatin**, was isolated from corn kernels and coconut milk.
*   **Key Functions:**
    1.  **Promotes Cell Division (Cytokinesis):** Its primary function.
    2.  **Overcomes Apical Dominance:** Promotes the growth of lateral buds, acting antagonistically to auxins.
    3.  **Delays Senescence (Richmond-Lang effect):** Promotes nutrient mobilization, which helps in delaying leaf aging.
    4.  **Promotes Chloroplast Development** and new leaf formation.

##### Ethylene: The Gaseous Ripener

*   **Discovery:** H.H. Cousins confirmed that ripe oranges released a volatile substance (ethylene) that hastened the ripening of bananas.
*   **Key Functions:**
    1.  **Fruit Ripening:** Highly effective in ripening fruits; enhances the respiration rate during ripening (respiratory climactic). **Ethephon** is a liquid source of ethylene.
    2.  **Senescence and Abscission:** Promotes the senescence and shedding of leaves, flowers, and fruits.
    3.  **Breaks Dormancy:** Breaks seed and bud dormancy and initiates germination (e.g., in peanut seeds).
    4.  **Promotes Root Growth:** Increases absorption surface area by promoting root and root hair formation.
    5.  **Flowering:** Synchronizes fruit-set in pineapples and induces flowering in mango.
    6.  **Promotes Female Flowers:** Increases the yield in cucumbers by promoting female flowers.

##### Abscisic Acid (ABA): The Stress Hormone

*   **Discovery:** Discovered independently as inhibitor-B, abscisin II, and dormin.
*   **Key Functions:**
    1.  **General Growth Inhibitor:** Inhibits plant metabolism and seed germination.
    2.  **Stomatal Closure:** Stimulates the closure of stomata during water stress, helping the plant tolerate desiccation. This is why it's called the **stress hormone**.
    3.  **Induces Dormancy:** Promotes dormancy in seeds and buds, helping them survive unfavorable conditions.
    4.  **Promotes Abscission** of leaves, flowers, and fruits.
    5.  **Antagonist to Gibberellins:** Acts as an antagonist to GA, particularly in relation to dormancy.

#### 5. Interaction of PGRs and Environmental Factors

Development in plants is controlled by a complex interplay of intrinsic (genetic, PGRs) and extrinsic (light, temperature, water, oxygen) factors. Events like dormancy, flowering, and germination are rarely controlled by a single factor but by synergistic or antagonistic interactions between multiple PGRs and the environment.

*   **Photoperiodism:** The response of plants to the relative lengths of day and night for flowering.
*   **Vernalisation:** The induction of flowering by a period of low-temperature treatment.
*Both photoperiodism and vernalisation are examples of how extrinsic factors (light and temperature) control development, often mediated by PGRs.*
