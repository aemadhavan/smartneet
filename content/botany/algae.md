# Algae

Algae are simple, autotrophic organisms that can be unicellular or multicellular. They are primarily aquatic and play a crucial role in ecosystems.

## Classification

### 1. Chlorophyceae (Green Algae)
- Contain chlorophyll a and b
- Store food as starch
- Cell wall made of cellulose
- Example: Chlamydomonas, Spirogyra

### 2. Phaeophyceae (Brown Algae)
- Contain chlorophyll a and c
- Store food as laminarin
- Cell wall made of cellulose and algin
- Example: Fucus, Laminaria

### 3. Rhodophyceae (Red Algae)
- Contain chlorophyll a and d
- Store food as floridean starch
- Cell wall made of cellulose and agar
- Example: Polysiphonia, Porphyra
