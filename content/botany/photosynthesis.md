# Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, producing oxygen and organic compounds.

## Overview

Photosynthesis is a complex process that occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. It can be summarized by the following equation:

```
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
```

## Key Components

### 1. Light-Dependent Reactions
- Occur in the thylakoid membranes
- Convert light energy into chemical energy (ATP and NADPH)
- Split water molecules, releasing oxygen

### 2. Calvin Cycle (Light-Independent Reactions)
- Occurs in the stroma
- Uses ATP and NADPH to convert CO₂ into glucose
- Also known as the C3 cycle

## Factors Affecting Photosynthesis

1. **Light Intensity**
   - Increases rate up to a point
   - Beyond saturation point, no further increase

2. **Carbon Dioxide Concentration**
   - Higher CO₂ levels increase rate
   - Limited by other factors

3. **Temperature**
   - Optimal range: 20-35°C
   - Too high or low temperatures reduce efficiency

4. **Water Availability**
   - Essential for the process
   - Affects stomatal opening
