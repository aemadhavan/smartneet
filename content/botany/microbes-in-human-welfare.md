### Introduction

While we often associate microbes with diseases, their beneficial roles are vast and indispensable to human life and the planet's ecosystems. The chapter "Microbes in Human Welfare" is a fascinating exploration of how these microscopic organisms are harnessed for our benefit, from making curd in our kitchens to producing life-saving antibiotics in large industries.

For the NEET exam, this chapter is considered high-yield and relatively easy to score. It is primarily a memory-based chapter, and you can expect **2-3 direct questions** from it. A thorough understanding of the specific microbes and their corresponding products or functions is key to securing full marks. This guide will systematically break down each application, providing clear tables, diagrams, and memory aids to help you master the content.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Microbes in Household Products

We use microbes or their products daily, often without realizing it.

*   **Curd:** Produced from milk by **Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)**, such as *Lactobacillus*. LAB produce acids that coagulate and partially digest milk proteins (casein). A small amount of curd acts as an inoculum or starter. Curd is also nutritionally superior to milk due to increased **Vitamin B₁₂**.
*   **Dough:** The puffed-up appearance of dough used for making foods like *dosa*, *idli*, and bread is due to the production of **CO₂ gas** during fermentation.
    *   **Bread:** Fermented using **Baker's Yeast** (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*).
*   **'Toddy':** A traditional drink from southern India, made by fermenting sap from palms.
*   **Cheese:** One of the oldest food items involving microbes. The texture, flavor, and taste are determined by the specific microbe used.
    *   **Swiss Cheese:** Characterized by large holes due to the production of a large amount of CO₂ by the bacterium **_Propionibacterium sharmanii_**.
    *   **Roquefort Cheese:** Ripened by growing a specific fungus, **_Penicillium roqueforti_**, on it, which gives it a particular flavor.

#### 2. Microbes in Industrial Products

Microbes are grown in very large vessels called **fermentors** to produce beverages, antibiotics, and other chemicals on an industrial scale.

*   **Fermented Beverages:**
    *   **Yeast:** *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (Brewer's Yeast) is used for fermenting malted cereals and fruit juices to produce ethanol.
    *   **Without Distillation:** Wine and Beer are produced without distillation.
    *   **With Distillation:** Whisky, Brandy, and Rum are produced by distilling the fermented broth.
*   **Antibiotics:**
    *   **Definition:** Chemical substances produced by some microbes that can kill or retard the growth of other (disease-causing) microbes.
    *   **Penicillin:** The first antibiotic to be discovered, it was a chance discovery by **Alexander Fleming**. He observed that the mould **_Penicillium notatum_** prevented the growth of *Staphylococci* bacteria. Its full potential was established by **Ernest Chain** and **Howard Florey**. The three shared the Nobel Prize in 1945.
*   **Chemicals, Enzymes, and other Bioactive Molecules:** This is an extremely important section for NEET.

| Product | Microbe | Category | Function/Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Citric Acid** | _Aspergillus niger_ | Fungus | Organic Acid |
| **Acetic Acid** | _Acetobacter aceti_ | Bacterium | Organic Acid |
| **Butyric Acid** | _Clostridium butylicum_| Bacterium | Organic Acid |
| **Lactic Acid** | _Lactobacillus_ | Bacterium | Organic Acid |
| **Ethanol** | _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_| Yeast (Fungus) | Alcohol |
| **Lipases** | (Various) | Enzyme | Used in detergent formulations to remove oily stains. |
| **Pectinases & Proteases**| (Various) | Enzymes | Used for clarifying bottled juices. |
| **Streptokinase** | _Streptococcus_ | Enzyme | "Clot buster" for removing clots from blood vessels (myocardial infarction). |
| **Cyclosporin A** | _Trichoderma polysporum_| Fungus | Bioactive Molecule | Immunosuppressive agent used in organ-transplant patients. |
| **Statins** | _Monascus purpureus_ | Yeast (Fungus) | Bioactive Molecule | Blood-cholesterol lowering agents. They act by competitively inhibiting the enzyme responsible for cholesterol synthesis. |

#### 3. Microbes in Sewage Treatment

Sewage is municipal wastewater containing large amounts of organic matter and pathogenic microbes. It cannot be discharged into natural water bodies without treatment in **Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs)**. The treatment is carried out in two stages:

1.  **Primary Treatment (Physical):**
    *   Involves the physical removal of large and small particles through **filtration** and **sedimentation**.
    *   Floating debris is removed by filtration.
    *   Grit (soil, pebbles) is removed by sedimentation.
    *   The settled solids form the **primary sludge**, and the supernatant forms the **primary effluent**.

2.  **Secondary Treatment (Biological):**
    *   The primary effluent is passed into large **aeration tanks**.
    *   Air is pumped in, and it is mechanically agitated, leading to the vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into **flocs** (masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments).
    *   These microbes consume the organic matter in the effluent, significantly reducing the **BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand)**.
    *   **BOD:** A measure of the organic matter present in water. It is the amount of oxygen that would be consumed if all organic matter in one liter of water were oxidized by bacteria. **Higher BOD indicates higher polluting potential.**
    *   Once BOD is reduced, the effluent is passed into a settling tank where the flocs sediment. This sediment is called **activated sludge**.
    *   A small part of the activated sludge is pumped back into the aeration tank to serve as an **inoculum**.
    *   The remaining major part is pumped into large tanks called **anaerobic sludge digesters**. Here, anaerobic bacteria digest the organic matter and produce **biogas**.

The effluent from the secondary treatment plant is generally released into rivers and streams. The **Ganga Action Plan** and **Yamuna Action Plan** have been initiated by the Ministry of Environment and Forests to build more STPs.

#### 4. Microbes in Production of Biogas

*   **Biogas:** A mixture of gases (predominantly **methane**) produced by microbial activity, used as fuel.
*   **Methanogens:** Bacteria that grow anaerobically on cellulosic material and produce a large amount of methane along with CO₂ and H₂. A common example is **_Methanobacterium_**.
*   **Location:** Methanogens are found in:
    1.  Anaerobic sludge during sewage treatment.
    2.  The **rumen** (a part of the stomach) of cattle, where they help in cellulose digestion.
*   **Gobar Gas Plant:** Cattle dung (gobar) is rich in methanogens and is used to produce biogas. The plant consists of a concrete tank where dung slurry is fed. A floating cover rises as gas is produced. The spent slurry is used as fertilizer.

#### 5. Microbes as Biocontrol Agents

Biocontrol refers to the use of biological methods for controlling plant diseases and pests, reducing the dependence on chemical pesticides.

*   **Ladybird (beetle)** and **Dragonflies** are used to get rid of **aphids** and **mosquitoes**, respectively.
*   **_Bacillus thuringiensis_ (Bt):** A bacterium used to control butterfly caterpillars. Available as dried spores, which are sprayed on plants. When ingested by the larvae, the toxin is released in their gut, killing them. This has been used to create genetically modified crops like **Bt-cotton**.
*   **_Trichoderma_:** A free-living fungus, very common in root ecosystems. They are effective biocontrol agents of several plant pathogens.
*   **Baculoviruses:** Pathogens that attack insects and other arthropods. The majority used are from the genus **_Nucleopolyhedrovirus_**. They are excellent candidates for **species-specific, narrow-spectrum** insecticidal applications, meaning they do not harm non-target insects, plants, birds, or mammals.

#### 6. Microbes as Biofertilisers

Biofertilisers are organisms that enrich the nutrient quality of the soil.

*   **Bacteria:**
    *   **_Rhizobium_:** Forms a symbiotic association with the roots of leguminous plants (root nodules) to fix atmospheric nitrogen.
    *   **_Azospirillum_** and **_Azotobacter_**: Free-living bacteria in the soil that can fix atmospheric nitrogen.
*   **Fungi:**
    *   **Mycorrhiza:** A symbiotic association between fungi and the roots of higher plants. The fungus, often from the genus **_Glomus_**, absorbs **phosphorus** from the soil and passes it to the plant. The plant, in turn, provides benefits like resistance to root-borne pathogens and tolerance to salinity and drought.
*   **Cyanobacteria (Blue-Green Algae):**
    *   Autotrophic microbes like **_Anabaena_, _Nostoc_,** and **_Oscillatoria_** can fix atmospheric nitrogen. They are important biofertilisers, especially in **paddy fields**.
