## Key Concepts

### 1. Root System Structure and Types

The **root system** forms the underground portion of flowering plants, primarily responsible for absorption, anchorage, and storage. Understanding root types is crucial for NEET preparation as questions frequently test the ability to distinguish between different root systems.

#### Tap Root System
- **Found in**: Dicotyledonous plants
- **Development**: Direct elongation of the radicle
- **Structure**: Primary root grows vertically downward and bears lateral roots of multiple orders (secondary, tertiary, etc.)
- **Examples**: Mustard, pea, and most dicot plants
- **Function**: Strong anchorage and deep soil penetration

#### Fibrous Root System
- **Found in**: Monocotyledonous plants
- **Development**: Primary root is short-lived and replaced by numerous roots from stem base
- **Structure**: Roots are roughly equal in size and form a dense network near soil surface
- **Examples**: Wheat, rice, and grass
- **Function**: Prevents soil erosion and absorbs surface water

#### Adventitious Roots
- **Origin**: Plant parts other than the radicle (stems or leaves)
- **Examples**: Banyan trees, Monstera, and grass
- **Functions**: Support (prop roots) and vegetative propagation

### 2. Root Anatomy and Regions

The **root tip** consists of four distinct regions:

| Region | Function | Characteristics |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Root Cap** | Protection | Thimble-like structure protecting root apex |
| **Meristematic Zone** | Cell division | Actively dividing cells with dense protoplasm |
| **Elongation Zone** | Growth | Rapid cell elongation for length increase |
| **Maturation Zone** | Specialization | Cell differentiation; root hairs develop |

### 3. Stem Morphology and Characteristics

The **stem** is the ascending axis of the plant, distinguished from roots by:

- ‚úÖ Presence of **nodes** (regions where leaves arise) and **internodes**
- ‚úÖ Development from the **plumule** of germinating seeds
- ‚úÖ Bearing of **buds** (terminal and axillary)
- ‚úÖ Generally green when young, becoming woody with age
- ‚úÖ Positive phototropic growth (growth toward light)

### 4. Leaf Structure and Venation

#### Basic Leaf Parts
- **Leaf base**: Attaches leaf to stem, may bear stipules
- **Petiole**: Leaf stalk that positions the blade optimally
- **Lamina**: The expanded, flat portion for photosynthesis

#### Venation Patterns
| Type | Pattern | Found in | Example |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Reticulate** | Network-like arrangement | Dicots | Rose, Mango |
| **Parallel** | Veins run parallel | Monocots | Wheat, Banana |

#### Leaf Types
1. **Simple leaves**: Lamina is entire or incisions don't reach midrib
2. **Compound leaves**: Incisions reach midrib, dividing into leaflets
   - **Pinnately compound**: Leaflets along central rachis (e.g., neem)
   - **Palmately compound**: Leaflets from common point (e.g., silk cotton)

### 5. Phyllotaxy Patterns

**Phyllotaxy** = Arrangement of leaves on stems

| **Whorled** | More than two leaves per node forming whorl | Alstonia |

### 6. Inflorescence Types

**Inflorescence** = Arrangement of flowers on floral axis

#### Racemose Inflorescence
- **Growth**: Main axis continues growing
- **Flower arrangement**: Borne laterally in acropetal succession
- **Examples**: Raceme, spike, panicle

#### Cymose Inflorescence
- **Growth**: Main axis terminates in flower (limited growth)
- **Flower arrangement**: Basipetal order
- **Examples**: Cyme, helicoid arrangements

### 7. Flower Structure and Components

The **flower** is a modified reproductive shoot with four main whorls:

#### 1. Calyx (Outermost whorl)
- **Composed of**: Sepals
- **Characteristics**: Typically green and protective
- **Types**: 
  - Gamosepalous (united sepals)
  - Polysepalous (free sepals)

#### 2. Corolla (Second whorl)
- **Composed of**: Petals
- **Function**: Attract pollinators (brightly colored)
- **Types**:
  - Gamopetalous (united petals)
  - Polypetalous (free petals)

#### 3. Androecium (Male reproductive whorl)
- **Composed of**: Stamens
- **Structure**: Each stamen has filament and anther
- **Function**: Contains pollen sacs for pollen production

#### 4. Gynoecium (Female reproductive whorl)
- **Composed of**: Carpels
- **Structure**: Each carpel has stigma, style, and ovary
- **Function**: Contains ovules for seed development

### 8. Flower Symmetry and Position

#### Flower Symmetry
